This practise represent the user all the information related to "Comunidades" (From Spain) into a Select Input on the first page. 

Then in the next page doing a QUERY it shows every "Provincias" from selected Community and in the last query page do the same but for "Localidades".

Finally in the last page, shows the complete direction and using latitude and altitude from every Locality thanks to the DB (which contains all the necessary data) and Google Maps JavaScript API it's possible to situate the selection in the map.
